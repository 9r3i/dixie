1. INTRODUCTION

   Dixie is the open source, free and simple CMS. This is created by 
Luthfie a.k.a. 9r3i [http://n8ro.hol.es/?id=profile] (my profile)

   Dixie is PHP scripting language, exactly native PHP and Javascript 
using jQuery Framework. Also compare PHP version to 5.3.28 and tested 
on version 5.5.2 but it's really work on version 5.4.7 as Luthfie 
created it on it.

   Dixie is using custom portable database class, it's called Ldb2, or 
second generation of Ldb, stand for Luthfie database, :D
As the version of Ldb is upgraded, now Dixie using Ldb v2.5 which is 
safer and faster.
For your information, Ldb is not PHP-SQL framework, this is an 
independent class and write the data in the specific directory.

   Dixie is now more compatible with low-tech browser such as mobile 
browser or IE9 or lower.

   Dixie is using the third-party application for post content editor, 
CK-Editor.

   Dixie is created for blogging but also it's compatible for website, 
there are so many sample website by using this CMS.

   I hope you enjoy this CMS. :)

   This section is to you for asking any question about Dixie. Me as 
the developer will help you to find the way out.

+ The menu is disappeared when I resize the browser. How can I find 
  the menu?
- The menu is hidden as the window is not wide-enough to show the

  three white strip right next to "Dixie" header title, click it, 
  then the menu will be shown.
